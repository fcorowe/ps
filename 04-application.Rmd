# Measuring Components of Population Change

Rates / ratios / indicators of components of population change:
a.	Fertility rates
b.	Migration rates
c.	Standardised mortality rates 
d.	Life expectancy
i.	Then, another example as final set of notes on data science approaches in this area, e.g. machine learning to predict life expectancy:
